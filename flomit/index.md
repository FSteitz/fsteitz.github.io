## A Short Venture
Florian Steitz and Michael Kornas founded the company in 2017 in order to provide fast, reliable and cheap IT services to small and medium-sized enterprises in and around Koblenz. But they refocused their efforts along the way and decided a little over a year later to finally disband the company. But they also decided to keep a few assets such as the domain names. That's why this page exists: It serves as a landing page for those domains.
